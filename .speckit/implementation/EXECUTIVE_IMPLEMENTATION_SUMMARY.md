---

#### Week 2-3: Phase 2 (Core Enhancement) - ADD AFTER VALIDATION

**Risk Level:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** (optional costs, high value)

**Option A: Budget-Conscious (FREE)**
```bash
# Use only FREE data sources
FINANCIAL_QUALIFICATION_ENABLED=true
ATTOM_API_KEY=              # Leave blank
MELISSA_API_KEY=            # Leave blank
# Will automatically use US Census data (FREE)

# Expected cost: $0
# Expected improvement: 60-70% better lead quality
```

**Option B: Full Bulletproof (PAID)**
```bash
# Use paid enrichment APIs
ATTOM_API_KEY=your_key_here  # $0.10 per lookup
MELISSA_API_KEY=your_key_here # $0.05 per lookup

# Expected cost: $0.15 per property
# Expected improvement: 82% better lead quality
```

**Action Items:**
1. ✅ Choose Option A (free) or Option B (paid)
2. ✅ Get API keys if using Option B
3. ✅ Follow `BULLETPROOF_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (Days 8-14)
4. ✅ Run A/B test (50% bulletproof, 50% standard)
5. ✅ Compare metrics after 2 weeks

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ 15-20% of leads rejected (financial disqualification)
- ✅ 30-40% qualified lead rate (up from 12%)

Only implement if:
- ✅ Phase 1+2 results exceed expectations
- ✅ Accuracy is critical (commercial, high-value)
- ✅ Budget allows for +$0.10 per lead cost

**Recommendation:** Postpone Phase 3+4 until Phase 1+2 proven successful

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks & Solutions

#### Risk 1: Over-Filtering (Too Many Rejections)

**Symptoms:**
- >50% of images rejected
- <20% qualified lead rate
- Lower revenue than before

**Solution:**
- Lower thresholds: `IMAGE_QUALITY_MIN_SCORE=60`
- Adjust financial criteria: `FINANCIAL_MIN_EQUITY_PERCENT=15.0`
- Re-calibrate scoring weights

---

#### Risk 2: Under-Filtering (Too Many False Positives)

**Symptoms:**
- <20% of images rejected
- False positive rate still >20%
- No improvement in conversion

**Solution:**
- Raise thresholds: `IMAGE_QUALITY_MIN_SCORE=80`
- Stricter financial criteria: `FINANCIAL_MIN_EQUITY_PERCENT=25.0`
- Add multi-model verification

---

#### Risk 3: API Cost Overruns

**Symptoms:**
- Daily API spend exceeds budget
- Cost per lead >$0.75

**Solution:**
- Enable selective enrichment: `SELECTIVE_ENRICHMENT_ENABLED=true`
- Use free APIs only: Remove Attom/Melissa keys
- Set hard cost limits: `MAX_COST_PER_LEAD=0.50`

---

#### Risk 4: Database Migration Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Migration errors
- Data loss
- Application downtime

**Solution:**
- ✅ Always backup database before migrations
- ✅ Test migrations on staging first
- ✅ Have rollback plan ready
- ✅ Run migrations during low-traffic periods
