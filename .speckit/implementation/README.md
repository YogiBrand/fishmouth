## 🚀 Implementation Path

### Week 1: Foundation (Start Here)

**Goal:** Implement image quality validation + feedback tracking  
**Cost:** $0 (no API costs)  
**Value:** 30% cost savings immediately

**Action Items:**
1. Read: [BULLETPROOF_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./BULLETPROOF_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) (Days 1-7)
2. Implement: Image Quality Validator
3. Implement: Feedback Tracking System
4. Run: Database migrations (Phase 1)
5. Test: Unit tests + integration tests

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 25-35% of images rejected (quality failures)
- ✅ $100+ savings per 1000 scans
- ✅ Zero production errors

---

### Week 2: Core Enhancement (After Validation)

**Goal:** Add data enrichment + advanced scoring  
**Cost:** $0-0.15 per lead (configurable)  
**Value:** 300% conversion improvement

**Action Items:**
1. Choose: Free APIs (Census) or Paid APIs (Attom/Melissa)
2. Get: API keys (if using paid)
3. Implement: Data Enrichment Service
4. Implement: Advanced Lead Scoring
5. Test: A/B test (50% bulletproof, 50% standard)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 35-40% qualified lead rate (up from 12%)
- ✅ 15-20% conversion rate (up from 4.5%)
- ✅ 82% reduction in false positives

---

### Week 3-4: Advanced Features (Optional)

**Goal:** Multi-model verification + production deployment  
**Cost:** +$0.10 per lead (optional)  
**Value:** Marginal accuracy improvements

**Recommendation:** **Postpone until Week 1-2 results proven**
