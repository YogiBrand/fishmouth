AI Roof Analysis         $150    (Claude Sonnet @ $0.15 ea)
Property Enrichment      $100    (existing service @ $0.10 ea)
Contact Enrichment       $100    (existing service @ $0.10 ea)
────────────────────────────────
TOTAL COST              $400    ($0.40 per property)

Leads Generated:         600 leads
False Positives:         270 leads (45%)
True Qualified Leads:     72 leads (12%)

**Per-Use Cost:** $0 (runs locally with OpenCV)  
**Savings Per 1000 Scans:** $45

**Breakdown:**
- Rejects 30% of images before AI analysis
- Saves: 300 × $0.15 = $45 in AI costs
- Saves: 300 × $0.10 = $30 in property enrichment
- Saves: 300 × $0.10 = $30 in contact enrichment
- **Total Savings: $105 per 1000 scans**

**ROI:** ∞ (zero ongoing cost, immediate savings)

### 2. Financial Qualification (Attom + Melissa Data)

**Investment:** 
- Attom Data API: $0.10 per lookup
- Melissa Data API: $0.05 per lookup
- **Total: $0.15 per property**

**Per 1000 Properties (after image filtering):**
- 700 properties × $0.15 = $105 enrichment cost

**Value Delivered:**
- Identifies 140 financially unqualified leads (20%)
- Prevents wasting time/money on leads who can't pay
- Saves contact costs: 140 × $0.25 = $35
- Saves sales team time: 140 × 15 min = 35 hours
- **Net Savings: $35 per 1000 + 35 hours of sales time**

**ROI:** 33% direct cost savings + massive time savings

**Alternative Cost Optimization:**
If Attom/Melissa are too expensive, you can:
- Use only US Census data (FREE) for area-level income estimates

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Selective Enrichment (Recommended)

Instead of enriching EVERY lead, only enrich high-potential leads:

```python
# Only enrich if initial indicators are strong
if (roof_analysis.condition_score < 60 and 
    roof_analysis.roof_age_years >= 15 and
    property_value >= 200000):
    # Run expensive enrichment
    financial_qual = await data_enricher.enrich_and_qualify(...)
else:
    # Skip enrichment for low-potential leads
    financial_qual = None
```

**Cost Savings:**
- Reduces enrichment volume by 60%
- New cost: 280 × $0.15 = $42 (vs $105)
- **Saves $63 per 1000 scans**

**Trade-off:** Might miss 5-10% of qualified leads, but cost savings justify it.

---

### 2. Free Data Sources Only

If budget is tight, use only FREE sources:

**Free Alternatives:**
- ✅ US Census API (area income, property values)
- ✅ Public property records (where available)
- ✅ Zillow/Redfin public estimates (scraped carefully)

**Cost:** $0 for data enrichment  
**Trade-off:** Less accurate, but still 3-5x better than no enrichment

---

### 3. Tiered Enrichment Strategy

Different enrichment levels based on user subscription:

**Trial Users (Free Tier):**
- Image quality validation only
- Basic scoring (no external data)
- Cost: $0.15 per lead

**Professional Tier ($99/month):**
- Image quality validation
- US Census data (FREE)
- Advanced scoring
- Cost: $0.15 per lead

**Enterprise Tier ($499/month):**
- Full bulletproof pipeline
- Attom + Melissa Data
- Multi-model verification
- Cost: $0.55 per lead
