2. /home/yogi/fishmouth/backend/services/providers/property_enrichment.py
3. /home/yogi/fishmouth/backend/services/providers/contact_enrichment.py
4. /home/yogi/fishmouth/backend/models.py (Lead model, lines 131-206)
```

**Questions to Answer:**
- ‚úÖ Does the current pipeline already have any quality controls?
- ‚úÖ Where exactly should image quality validation be injected?
- ‚úÖ Are there existing enrichment services we can leverage?
- ‚úÖ What's the current cost per lead (actual)?

## üí° Guiding Principles for Your Decisions

1. **Start Small, Scale Smart**
   - Prefer Phase 1 (free) over Phase 2 (paid) initially
   - Validate results before expanding investment

2. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**
   - Don't reinvent wheels - use what's already built
   - Enhance existing services rather than replace

3. **Cost-Conscious**
   - Free > Cheap > Expensive
   - Prove ROI before increasing costs

4. **Minimal Breaking Changes**
   - Preserve existing functionality
   - Add, don't replace (unless necessary)

5. **Measurable Impact**
   - Every change should have clear success metrics
   - Track before/after to validate improvements
