```

---

### 3. Background Infrastructure

- [x] Lead pipeline can run inline (default)
- [x] Lead pipeline can run offline (Celery workers)
- [x] Sequence engine can run inline (default)
- [x] Sequence engine can run offline (Celery workers)
- [x] Toggle via feature flags

**Verification:**
```bash
# Inline mode (default)
USE_INLINE_SCAN_RUNNER=true

# Celery mode
USE_INLINE_SCAN_RUNNER=false
celery -A backend.celery_app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```

---

### 4. Database Migrations
- [x] Alembic scaffolded
- [x] `backend/alembic.ini` configured
- [x] `backend/alembic/env.py` set up
- [x] `backend/alembic/script.py.mako` template ready
- [x] `backend/MIGRATIONS.md` runbook created
- [x] Initial revision generated: `6eef61f13528`
- [x] Database stamped with baseline
- [x] Schema changes are safely versioned

**Verification:**
```bash
cd backend
alembic current  # Shows: 6eef61f13528 (head)
alembic history  # Shows migration history
```

---

### 5. Documentation & Dependencies
- [x] README.md updated with new tooling
- [x] Worker/beat startup instructions added
- [x] `backend/requirements.txt` updated with:
  - [x] structlog
  - [x] sentry-sdk
  - [x] prometheus-client
  - [x] celery[redis]
  - [x] alembic
- [x] `PLAYBOOK_1_COMPLETE.md` created (comprehensive guide)
- [x] `backend/MIGRATIONS.md` created (migration guide)
- [x] `PLAYBOOK_1_SUMMARY.txt` created (quick reference)

---

## 🏃 Running Services

### Inline Mode (Default - No Celery)
```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

### With Celery Workers
```bash
# Terminal 1: Main API
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Celery Worker
celery -A backend.celery_app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info

# Terminal 3: Celery Beat
celery -A backend.celery_app.celery_app beat --loglevel=info
```

### With Docker
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📝 Next Steps

Playbook 1 is **COMPLETE** ✅

You can now:
1. ✅ Deploy to production with confidence
2. ✅ Scale horizontally by adding Celery workers
3. ✅ Monitor system health (logs, metrics, traces)
4. ✅ Manage schema changes safely with migrations
5. ✅ Toggle features without code changes

**Ready for Playbook 2: Lead Pipeline Hardening**

## 🎯 Codex's Original Requirements

All items from Codex's response have been completed:

> ✅ Centralized configuration: backend/config.py now manages Celery, feature flags (including inline/offline runners), observability, storage, and provider credentials. All modules read from this single source of truth.

> ✅ Structured logging & telemetry: logging_config.py bootstraps structlog; FastAPI middleware binds X-Request-ID, optional Sentry tracing is wired, and Prometheus metrics expose automatically when enabled.

> ✅ Background infrastructure: Added celery_app.py plus task modules for scans, sequences, and analytics. The lead pipeline and sequence engine can run inline (default) or farm work to Celery workers by simply toggling feature flags.

> ✅ Database migrations: Alembic is scaffolded with config, env, script template, and a runbook (MIGRATIONS.md) so schema changes are safely versioned.

> ✅ Docs & deps updated: README now lists the new tooling and describes how to run workers/beat; backend/requirements.txt includes structlog, sentry-sdk, and Prometheus instrumentation.

## 🎉 Success!

**Playbook 1 is fully implemented and production-hardened.**

The foundation is solid. Let's build something amazing! 🚀
