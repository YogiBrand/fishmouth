## üö´ What NOT to Build (Phase 2)

These features are coming later - **do NOT build them in Phase 1**:

- ‚ùå AI ad generation (Claude for copy, DALL-E for images)
- ‚ùå Video ad creation
- ‚ùå Facebook Ads API integration
- ‚ùå Google Ads API integration
- ‚ùå Campaign management
- ‚ùå Direct mail integration (Lob.com)
- ‚ùå Postcard/letter generation
- ‚ùå Advanced n8n workflows

**Why?**: These are important but not critical for MVP. We need to prove the core value (lead generation + AI agents) first.
