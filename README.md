# üè† Fish Mouth - AI-Powered Roofing Lead Generation Platform

**Version 3.0** | Self-Hosted | AI-First | Quality-Based Pricing

---

## üéØ What is Fish Mouth?

Fish Mouth is a comprehensive lead generation and sales automation platform designed specifically for roofing contractors. It uses AI to analyze aerial imagery, identify aged roofs, generate high-quality leads, create persuasive marketing materials, and automate complete sales sequences including AI voice calls.

### Key Features

- ü§ñ **AI Roof Detection** - Claude Vision analyzes aerial imagery to identify aged roofs
- üìä **Quality-Based Pricing** - Only pay for leads with 60+ quality score
- üìß **Intelligent Sequences** - Automate email, SMS, calls with AI-generated content
- üìû **AI Voice Agent** - Automated sales calls with objection handling
- üé® **Campaign Management** - Facebook & Google Ads integration
- üíå **Direct Mail** - Automated postcard & letter sending
- üéØ **Lead Scoring** - 0-100 score based on roof age, condition, property value

---

## üîç Roof Analysis Pipeline

Fish Mouth now ships with a production-ready roof intelligence stack that combines property data, satellite imagery, and computer vision to surface the highest-intent opportunities.

### How it Works

1. **Property Discovery** ‚Äì The scan service queries Mapbox (or OpenStreetMap/Nominatim) to obtain exact coordinates for every residential address in the target market.  
2. **Property Enrichment** ‚Äì Each candidate is enriched with year built, home value, square footage, and historical roof data via Estated (or deterministic fallbacks).  
3. **Imagery Capture** ‚Äì High-resolution aerial images are pulled from Mapbox Satellite with automatic Google Static Maps fallback and cached locally for auditing.  
4. **Computer Vision Analysis** ‚Äì A NumPy/Pillow pipeline evaluates granule loss, dark streaks, moss growth, texture variance, and edge density to estimate roof age, condition, and urgency.  
5. **Contact Enrichment** ‚Äì Owner name, phone, and email are appended through TruePeopleSearch (or deterministic fallback) with confidence scoring.  
6. **Scoring Engine** ‚Äì A weighted model blends roof health, age, property value, damage indicators, and contact confidence into the final 0-100 lead score + HOT/WARM/COLD priority.

Every lead returned to the dashboard includes a full AI summary, damage indicators, imagery provenance, scoring breakdown, and booking-value estimate so sales teams can move immediately.

### Required Environment Variables

Set the following in `.env` to enable live enrichment:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MAPBOX_TOKEN` | Access token for high-res satellite tiles & geocoding |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Backup imagery provider (optional but recommended) |
| `PROPERTY_ENRICHMENT_API_KEY` | Estated (or equivalent) API key for property records |
| `CONTACT_ENRICHMENT_API_KEY` | TruePeopleSearch (or similar) API key for homeowner contacts |
| `TELNYX_API_KEY` | Telnyx API key for SMS/voice call control |
| `TELNYX_MESSAGING_PROFILE_ID` | Telnyx messaging profile to send outbound SMS |
| `TELNYX_CALL_CONTROL_APP_ID` | Telnyx call control application (for outbound/inbound calls) |
| `TELNYX_FROM_NUMBER` | Verified Telnyx number used as the caller ID |
| `TELNYX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Shared secret used to verify legacy Telnyx webhook callbacks (HMAC) |
| `TELNYX_WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEY` | Ed25519 public key used to verify Telnyx webhook signatures |
| `PII_HASH_SALT` | Optional salt used when hashing PII (phone/email) for compliance |
| `PII_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Base64 Fernet key for encrypting stored PII (generate via `python -m cryptography.fernet`) |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe API secret used for usage-based billing |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` | Stripe metered price ID associated with your subscription plan |
| `STORAGE_BASE_URL` | (Optional) Public URL prefix for served aerial imagery |

If any of these are omitted the system gracefully falls back to deterministic synthetic data to keep demos running while you secure credentials.

## üìä Dashboard & Workflow Enhancements

- **Export Anything** ‚Äî Download filtered lead lists or per-scan CSVs directly from the dashboard for quick sharing with your crews.  
- **Real-Time AI Activity Feed** ‚Äî Track every AI touchpoint (calls, emails, SMS, sequence outcomes) in a single timeline sourced from the new `/api/activities` endpoint.  
- **Scan Result Workspace** ‚Äî Dedicated view for each area scan with summary analytics, damage distribution, and tabular leads enriched with imagery, contact data, and scores.  
- **Voice Agent Console** ‚Äî Monitor AI voice calls, outcomes, and duration metrics from the `Voice Calls` tab without leaving the app.  
- **Production-Ready Sequences** ‚Äî Redesigned React Flow builder with auto-layout, richer content editors, and a hardened backend executor so sequences run end-to-end in production.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- 8GB RAM minimum
- API Keys (see below)

### 1. Clone & Setup

```bash
cd /home/yogi/fishmouth
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### 2. Get API Keys

Required:
- **Anthropic** (Claude AI): https://console.anthropic.com
- **ElevenLabs** (Voice): https://elevenlabs.io
- **Telnyx** (Calls/SMS): https://telnyx.com
- **Deepgram** (Speech-to-text): https://deepgram.com
- **Stripe** (Payments): https://stripe.com
- **Mapbox** (Imagery): https://mapbox.com

### 3. Configure Telnyx Webhooks

Point your Telnyx Call Control & Messaging webhooks to:

- `POST https://<your-domain>/api/webhooks/telnyx`

Provide the same `TELNYX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` or `TELNYX_WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEY` you added to `.env`; the API verifies `Telnyx-Signature-Ed25519` headers (falling back to `Telnyx-Signature-256` HMAC when a public key is not configured).

For real-time audio streaming, Telnyx Call Control should be instructed to stream to:

- `wss://<your-domain>/api/voice/stream/{call_id}`

The backend waits for that stream before bridging audio into Deepgram/ElevenLabs.
- **Google Maps** (Geocoding): https://console.cloud.google.com
- **Lob** (Direct Mail): https://lob.com

### 3. Start Services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Access:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs

## üìñ Key Concepts

### Lead Scoring (0-100)

```
Score = (Roof Age √ó 0.4) + (Damage √ó 0.3) + (Property Value √ó 0.15) + (Location √ó 0.15)
```

- **HOT (80-100)**: Immediate action required
- **WARM (60-79)**: Good opportunity  
- **COLD (<60)**: Not charged, not saved

### Quality-Based Pricing

- Only charge for leads with 60+ score
- Leads below 60 are FREE (not saved)
- 80% profit margin ($1.13 charge vs $0.225 cost)

### Sequence Automation

- Vertical node-based builder (Paragon-style)
- AI generates content at each step
- Node types: Email, SMS, Call, Wait, Condition, Research
- Respects working hours & time zones

### AI Voice Agent

- Natural conversation using Claude Sonnet 4
- ElevenLabs for voice synthesis
- Handles objections automatically
- Schedules appointments
- Generates call summaries
- Telnyx call-control streams bridged to Deepgram/ElevenLabs in real time via FastAPI websockets
- Ed25519 webhook verification, failover retries, and transcript playback inside the console
