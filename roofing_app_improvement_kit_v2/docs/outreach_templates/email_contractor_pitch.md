Subject: 25–50 qualified roof leads/mo in {market}

Hi {first_name},

We run **Fishmouth**, a local-first roof lead engine. We combine aerial/street imagery, permits, and storm signals to surface **ready-to-buy** homeowners in {market}.

You’d get:
- Verified owner contact info
- Damage/age analysis with photos
- Clusters for efficient routing
- “Fish Hook” call & email templates

Want to test **10 free leads** this week? If they close, we scale to 25–50/mo. Quick call?
