# Voice Script — Fish Hook Offer (60–75 sec)

Hi {owner_name}, this is {agent_name} with {brand}. We analyzed your roof at {address} from recent aerial imagery and found a few signs it may need attention—nothing alarming, but worth a free inspection.

We’re offering a **no‑cost, 15‑minute roof check** and a **written photo report**. Two quick options: **tomorrow at 5:30pm** or **Thursday at 8:30am**. Which works best?

If now’s not ideal, I’ll text a link so you can book anytime. Thanks, and we’ll send the report regardless—no obligation.
