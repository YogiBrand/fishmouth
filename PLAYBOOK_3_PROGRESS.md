# ðŸš€ Playbook 3 â€“ Autonomous Sequences (In Progress)

## âœ… Completed This Iteration
- **Execution Pipeline**: Added `sequence_executions` table + logging to track every step with provider metadata.
- **Resilient Scheduling**: Replaced inline sleeps with `sequence_scheduler.py`; Celery workers (or inline fallback) now queue node execution via `dispatch_pending_sequences` / `execute_enrollment` tasks.
- **Delivery Abstraction**: Implemented `sequence_delivery.py` with mock adapters and live stubs (SendGrid/Postmark, Telnyx SMS/Voice) respecting `USE_MOCK_SEQUENCE_DELIVERY`.
- **API Enhancements**: New `PUT /api/sequences/enrollments/{id}` endpoint enables pause/resume/cancel/mark converted + timeline lead activities. Added `GET /api/leads/{lead_id}/sequences` for UI use.
- **Frontend Controls**: Lead detail page now surfaces active enrollments with per-stage controls, sourcing data from the new API. Lead lists already display data-quality badges from Playbook 2.
- **Tests**: Added `backend/tests/test_sequence_delivery.py` to verify mock delivery adapters.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps
1. **Adapter hardening**: Flesh out live SendGrid/Postmark/Telnyx adapters with retry + metrics once credentials are supplied (ties into Playbook 4 voice pipeline).
2. **Conditional Logic**: Replace mock condition evaluation with real engagement checks (email opens, SMS replies, call outcomes) and surface them in the timeline.
3. **Timeline Consolidation**: Stream sequence execution logs (`sequence_executions`) directly into the activity feed with richer metadata + filters.
4. **Worker Monitoring**: Expose Prometheus counters (success/failure per adapter) and add dashboard panels.

## Looking Ahead
- **Playbook 4**: Integrate the voice streaming stack (Deepgram/ElevenLabs/OpenAI) using the new voice adapter hook.
- **Playbook 5**: Materialize analytics feeds (sequence performance, ROI) and extend admin/billing APIs.
- **Playbook 6**: CI/CD gates, compliance (PII encryption, consent tracking), and expanded documentation/test coverage.
