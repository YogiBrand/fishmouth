# ðŸ“Š Playbook 5 â€“ Analytics, Admin & Billing (Complete)

## âœ… Completed in this iteration
- **Usage Tracking** â€“ New `billing_usage` table + helper service records per-user activity (voice seconds, SMS, emails) whenever automations run.
- **Admin Billing APIs** â€“ `GET /api/admin/billing/usage`, `GET /api/admin/billing/users/{id}`, and the new `GET /api/admin/billing/summary` power realtime dashboards.
- **Cost Attribution** â€“ Email/SMS deliveries and AI voice calls post usage entries with granular metadata for downstream invoicing dashboards.
- **Stripe Provisioning** â€“ Admin endpoint `POST /api/admin/billing/users/{user_id}/provision` creates customers/subscriptions and writes IDs back to the user record.
- **Finance Tooling** â€“ Enhanced admin UI with revenue cards, charts, and CSV exports including platform margin reconciliation.
- **Billing Exports** â€“ Added `/api/admin/billing/export/period` for period-based reconciliation with provider vs platform splits.

## Next Actions
1. Add scheduled jobs to sync Stripe subscription status changes back into the platform.
2. Automate invoice PDF generation once pricing tiers are finalized.
