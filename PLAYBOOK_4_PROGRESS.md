# üéôÔ∏è Playbook 4 ‚Äì Voice Agent Productionization (Complete)

## ‚úÖ Completed in this iteration
- **Provider Abstraction Layer** ‚Äì Added `backend/services/voice/providers.py` with interchangeable ASR (Deepgram), TTS (ElevenLabs), and LLM (OpenAI/Anthropic) adapters that fall back to deterministic mocks when credentials are absent.
- **AI Call Pipeline** ‚Äì Rebuilt `VoiceAgentService` to orchestrate call lifecycle end-to-end: call creation, scripted conversation, transcript persistence (`voice_call_turns`), AI summary generation, cost accounting, and automatic booking creation.
- **Consent & Compliance** ‚Äì Leads now store voice-consent flags (`voice_opt_out`, timestamps). Call start checks DNC status and records activities. Lead contact timestamps (`last_voice_contacted`) are captured for auditing.
- **Metrics & Analytics** ‚Äì Call executions update `VoiceMetricsDaily`, exposing aggregate stats through the existing analytics endpoint.
- **API + UI Enhancements** ‚Äì Voice endpoints return summaries, recommended next steps, and cost metrics; the React Voice Console now includes transcript playback, advanced filters, and KPI charts.
- **Telnyx Webhook Endpoint** ‚Äì Hardened `/api/webhooks/telnyx` with Ed25519 signature verification, call state updates, and voice activity logging.
- **Real-Time Media Bridge** ‚Äì Telnyx call audio is streamed over FastAPI websockets into Deepgram/ElevenLabs with automatic failover and retry logic.
- **Operator Dashboard Polish** ‚Äì Added transcript drill-down modal, analytics cards, and filterable call history.
- **Regression Coverage** ‚Äì Added async tests for the voice pipeline (`backend/tests/test_voice_agent.py`) to ensure summaries and consent checks behave correctly.

## Next Actions
1. **Advanced Safety** ‚Äì Add keyword-level opt-out detection and escalation safeguards.
2. **Provider Telemetry** ‚Äì Capture latency metrics and surface degraded provider alerts.
3. **CI Simulation** ‚Äì Expand deterministic audio/JSON fixtures to replay complex conversations end-to-end.
