# üõ°Ô∏è Playbook 6 ‚Äì Compliance, QA, & Finishing Touches (In Progress)

## ‚úÖ Completed in this iteration
- **PII Hashing & Encryption** ‚Äì Leads persist SHA-256 hashes and optional Fernet-encrypted contact data when `PII_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set; exports decrypt on demand.
- **Audit Logging** ‚Äì New `audit_logs` table + helper records critical actions (lead updates, enrollment changes, voice call state transitions, anonymization).
- **Voice Event Journal** ‚Äì Telnyx webhook events stored in `voice_call_events` for downstream QA and incident review.
- **Right-to-Be-Forgotten** ‚Äì Admin endpoint `/api/admin/users/{id}/forget` scrubs leads, voice calls, billing usage, and audit trails, and anonymizes the user record.
- **Encryption Tests** ‚Äì Added unit coverage for Fernet round-trips and billing summaries to guard CI regressions.

## Next Actions
1. Integrate managed KMS for key rotation and secret management.
2. Expand synthetic audio fixtures and CI smoke tests for encryption-enabled environments.
3. Surface DSR reporting dashboards for privacy & compliance teams.
