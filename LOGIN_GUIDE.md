## 🔧 Technical Details

### File Changes
1. **Created:** `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` (265 lines)
2. **Modified:** `frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx` (role-based redirect)
3. **Modified:** `frontend/src/pages/Signup.jsx` (dashboard redirect)
4. **Modified:** `frontend/src/App.jsx` (added `/dashboard` route)

### Route Configuration
```javascript
// Public Routes
/ → Home (Landing page)
/login → Login
/signup → Signup
/admin/login → Admin Login

// Protected Routes (require authentication)
/dashboard → User Dashboard (ProtectedRoute)
/admin/dashboard → Admin Dashboard (AdminRoute)
```

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User submits login form
2. AuthContext.login() is called
3. Backend validates credentials
4. If successful:
   - Token stored in localStorage
   - User data stored in localStorage
   - AuthContext updates user state
5. Login.jsx checks user.role
6. Redirects to appropriate dashboard
```

## ✅ System Architecture

```
Frontend (React) ← → Proxy ← → Backend (FastAPI) ← → Database (PostgreSQL)
     :3000                          :8000                   :5432

Frontend Container:
- Runs on port 3000
- setupProxy.js routes /auth, /api, /health to backend
- Uses relative URLs (empty string API_URL)

Backend Container:
- Runs on port 8000
- Connected to fishmouth_fishmouth_network
- Accessible from frontend via proxy

Both containers on same Docker network: fishmouth_default
```

## 📊 Current System Status

```
✅ Frontend:  Running on http://localhost:3000
✅ Backend:   Running on http://localhost:8000  
✅ Database:  Connected and healthy
✅ Proxy:     Working perfectly
✅ Login:     Role-based redirects working
✅ Dashboard: User dashboard created and functional
✅ Protected Routes: Configured and tested
✅ Admin Dashboard: Existing and functional
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If login redirects to home instead of dashboard:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console
2. Look for "Login successful!" messages
3. Check if user.role is being set correctly
4. Verify localStorage has token and user data
5. Try clearing browser cache and cookies

### If you see "Cannot connect to server":
1. Check backend is running: `docker ps | grep backend`
2. Test backend directly: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
3. Check frontend proxy: `docker logs fishmouth_frontend | grep proxy`
4. Restart containers: `docker-compose restart`

### If protected routes don't work:
1. Check AuthContext is providing user state
2. Verify token is in localStorage
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try logging out and back in

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check container logs: `docker logs fishmouth_frontend` or `docker logs fishmouth_backend`
2. Verify all containers running: `docker-compose ps`
3. Test backend directly: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
4. Clear browser storage and try again
