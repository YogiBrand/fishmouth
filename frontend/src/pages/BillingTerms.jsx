          </div>

          <h2 id="plans">1. Plans & Pricing</h2>
          <p>Subscription tiers, usage limits, and prices are shown during sign‚Äëup or in your account. Promotional credits or trials may apply as stated at the time of purchase.</p>

          <h2 id="payment">2. Payment & Authorization</h2>
          <p>You authorize us (and our payment processors) to charge your selected payment method for all fees due for the subscription term. You agree to keep payment information current and accurate.</p>

          <h2 id="renewal">3. Auto‚ÄëRenewals & Cancellations</h2>
          <p>Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled before the next renewal date. You can cancel at any time via account settings; access continues through the end of the current term.</p>

          <h2 id="refunds">4. Refunds</h2>
          <p>Except where required by law or outlined in our 30-day money-back guarantee, fees are non‚Äërefundable and non‚Äëcreditable once charged.</p>

            <p className="text-slate-700 text-[15px] leading-relaxed">
              Some features rely on third‚Äëparty services (e.g., imagery APIs, telecom, email). Those direct provider charges are pass‚Äëthrough and non‚Äërefundable. We apply a
              modest Operational Cost Recovery Charge (OCRC) of <strong>1.70√ó</strong> the provider‚Äôs unit rate to cover platform operations (orchestration, observability,
              infrastructure, security/compliance, and payment processing).

            <p className="text-slate-700 text-[15px] leading-relaxed mt-2">Actual rates vary by provider and destination.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="guarantee">5. 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee</h2>
          <p>
            New subscription plans include a 30-day money-back guarantee on Fish Mouth platform fees. To qualify, submit your cancellation request
            and refund claim to billing@fishmouth.io within 30 calendar days of your initial charge. Upon approval, we refund all subscription fees
            you paid for that period.
          </p>
          <p>
            The guarantee does not cover direct pass‚Äëthrough usage or the OCRC (1.70√ó of the provider unit rate), which reflect the real cost of fulfilling your usage.
            We will itemize provider, quantity, and unit rates on the refund confirmation.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the 30-day window, standard refund terms in Section 4 apply. This guarantee is in addition to any rights you may have under applicable law.
          </p>

          <h2 id="changes">6. Changes to Prices & Plans</h2>
          <p>We may change pricing or plan features prospectively with reasonable notice. Changes take effect at the next renewal unless otherwise agreed.</p>

          <h2 id="taxes">7. Taxes</h2>
          <p>Fees exclude taxes unless specified. You are responsible for applicable taxes, duties, and government charges.</p>

          <h2 id="failed">8. Failed Payments</h2>
          <p>If a charge fails, we may attempt to re‚Äëprocess and may suspend or downgrade the Service until payment is made. You remain responsible for amounts due for the then‚Äëcurrent term.</p>

          <h2 id="third">9. Third‚ÄëParty Fees</h2>
          <p>Your carrier or other providers may charge fees (e.g., for calls/SMS) that are separate from our subscription fees.</p>
